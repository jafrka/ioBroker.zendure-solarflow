## Zendure Solarflow adapter for ioBroker

This project is an ioBroker Adapter to read data from the Zendure Solarflow Cloud API. It uses the official API provided by Zendure.
You can read more about the API here: https://github.com/Zendure/developer-device-data-report

Note: It is possible to control the Output limit with the state created in the productId/deviceKey/control subfolder.

Note2: You will be logged out of the official iOS or Android App after logging in with the ioBroker adapter. This is a normal behavior, currently I
don't know why. If you have more information, feel free to contact me.

## Credits
